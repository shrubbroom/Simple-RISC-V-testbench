* Simple-RISC-V-testbench
A public testbench for RISC-V design (MR329). The directory [[./test/][test]]
includes all the test cases in assembly. The directory [[./emulator/][emulator]]
includes the source code of an emulator written in C++. The directory
[[./assembler/][assembler]] includes the source code of assembler.
** How to use?
This is an automatic testbench for the course design of MR329
(Computer Architecture). It use the GitHub Action as the test
environment and compare your HDL source files' simulation result with
an emulator written in C.

To use this testbench:
   1. Fork this repository. If you don't wish a public repository
      containing your source code, initialize an empty private
      repository and copy all the stuff into your new repository. Note
      that you should follow GPLv3, i.e. don't forget to include the
      license in your new repository.
   2. Clone the forked repository to your host machine and modify the
      files [[./single/riscv_soc_tb.v][testbench in single]] and [[pipeline/riscv_soc_tb.v][testbench in pipeline]]
      #+BEGIN_SRC verilog
         for (i = 0; i <= 1023; i = i+1) begin
            $fwrite(handle, "%h\n", riscv_soc_tb.data_mem0.data[i]); // change the riscv_soc_tb.data_mem0.data[i] to the instance of your data memory
         end
      #+END_SRC

      #+BEGIN_SRC verilog
      for (i = 1; i <= 31; i = i+1) begin
         $fwrite(handle, "%h\n", riscv_soc_tb.riscv0.RF.register_file[i]); // change the riscv_soc_tb.riscv0.RF.register_file[i] to the instance of your register file
      end
      #+END_SRC
   3. Move your source file to [[./single/][single]] and [[./pipeline/][pipeline]]
   4. Properly place =`include= in each file to make a full hierarchy
      relation. e.g.

   [[file:Simple-RISC-V-testbench/2020-12-18_22-31-32_screenshot.png]]
   5. Commit, push and wait for the result.
   6. Change the file [[.github/workflows/yosys.yaml][yosys.yaml]] and [[./testbench.sh][testbench.sh]] to change the test
      target (disable pipeline test, etc.).  For example, you want to
      close pipeline check, just comment related line:

** Something more
   If you can pass all the test cases, your HDL sources is *likely* to
   be correct. If you find any problem with the testbench or have some
   good(vicious) test case, please do not hesitate to contact me,
   raise an issue or make a pull request directly.
